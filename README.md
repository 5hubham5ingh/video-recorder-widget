# Web-Based video and screen capture

A free, open-source, and minimal web-based video recorder that operates entirely locally. Capture your screen, a specific tab or window, or your webcam, with or without audio.

Available [live](https://5hubham5ingh.github.io/video-recorder-widget) as a GitHub Page for complete transparency.

**Why Use This?**

* Eliminates the need to download heavy applications or browser extensions for quick video capture.
* Platform-independent, as it functions entirely within a web browser.
* No adds or need to worry about privacy as the app runs entirely on the local machine and does not send any data to any server.
* Minimal and fast.
